# aux_dictionary

The raw data comes from the repo `PIP-Technical-Team/variable_diccionary`, which should be deprecated in the near future. Ideally, that old repo should not be updated anymore and only this repo should be used. 

**WARNING:** If you update the `dictionary.csv` file manually in this repo, you should NOT use the `r/from_old_repo.R` script anymore.
